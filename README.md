**ABSTRACT **
 
The purpose of the “Student-Teacher Booking Appointment Web Application” is to automate the existing manual records of appointment by the help of computerized equipment’s and full- fledged web application, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be store for a longer period with easy access and manipulation of the same. This project aims to create a web application that facilitates Student-Teacher Booking appointments and managing meetings for an organization. This web application includes features such as student registration, booking appointment, takes query, teacher login, schedule appointment and view queries. The project follows a structured methodology including requirement analysis, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance, ensuring a high-quality, scalable, and secure solution. 

“Student-Teacher Booking Appointment Web Application”, as described above, can lead to error free, secure, reliable, and fast management website. It can assist the  user in concentrating on their other activities rather than concentrate on record keeping. Thus, it will help the organization in better utilization of resources. The organization can maintain computerized records without redundant entries. That means that one need not be distracted by information that is not relevant, while being able to reach the information.

Technologies that I have used in the webiste are:-

**HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,PHP and FIREBASE**

* Hyper Text Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages. 

* Cascading Style Sheet is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS defines how elements should be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

* JAVASCRIPT is a versatile programming language primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive elements on websites.

*Php is also used to store the database but it store the data in the local device.   

* Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. It provides a suite of tools and services to help developers build, improve, and grow their apps. Key features include a real-time NoSQL database, authentication services, cloud storage, hosting, and analytics.
